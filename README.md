This project will focus on developing a user-friendly platform that can be easily adapted to meet the needs of both public and private hospitals in Sri Lanka. By implementing HealthNet, we aim to bring Sri Lanka's healthcare system up to modern standards, ensuring that patients receive timely and efficient care.
